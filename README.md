## Details
Risk of suffering from specific diseases are related with specific genetic mutations. One special class of genetic mutations is called SNP - single-nucleotide polymorphism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism). Which is the variation of a single nucleotide.
In order to understand the mechanism of a SNP's effect one usually needs to find out which genes were affected by SNP. Therefore it is necessary to locate a chromosome, a gene, a codon and a resulting amino-acid before and after the mutation.
